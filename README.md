This is a beginners attempt to learning Python and for assembling data from a CPTu file.
In addition, this beginner is new to the AGS format for data, but sees how this can be useful for many geo applications.
The file is clunky because of all the inserted statements for each calculation step and for each dataframe column.
A csv file is included, but this just has headers so you will fill in the basic CPTu data.... And as stated, this is kPa, not MPa.  
The 3D plot is not acceptable, but could use some more features.
